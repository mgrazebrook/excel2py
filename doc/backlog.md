- Backlog

- Config file

- Implement the config as yaml

- Do the precedence right
Command line overrides general config overrides generic? 
Do I want multiple levels of config file?
I've written default values - but is that compatible 
with precedence?

- Command line option generates a config template
Optional sections can be commented out. 
Lines it contains must be defaults

- Solve the TatSu bug

-  Name

proforma2py? It's not really generic excel to py.

 - Comments from the Excel

Sometimes cells don't have names. Could we add associated text 
in Excel as a comment?

- More tests

- Excel can have a tailing comma in function params

- Sum of a list of variables, e.g. ResultsG35G39

It's using formulae from the cells where it should be using the cell names
